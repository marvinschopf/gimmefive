# GimmeFive

**GimmeFive** adds a High Five button (in the form of a "snack bar") to your website, which is synchronised, i.e. updated simultaneously for all users on your website!

## Installation

Direct integration via a CDN such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) is recommended.

For a simple integration _without synchronization_ you just have to add the following tags to the end of the `<body>` HTML tag.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gimmefive@1/dist/gimmefive.min.js"></script>
<script>
	GimmeFive.init();
</script>
```
